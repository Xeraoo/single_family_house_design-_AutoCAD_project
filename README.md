# üè† Single-Family House Design - AutoCAD Project

**`Civil Engineering Fundamentals - AGH University of Science and Technology`**

This repository contains a detailed architectural design of a single-family house created using AutoCAD as part of a coursework assignment for the Civil Engineering Fundamentals course.

## üìã Project Overview
The design illustrates a **vertical cross-section** of a three-story house, showcasing various structural components, dimensions, and materials. The project adheres to civil engineering standards and includes detailed construction elements and annotations, with all measurements provided in **centimeters**.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-level cross-section**: The drawing displays three floors, including a basement, ground floor, and attic. 
- **Structural details**: Key building elements like the walls, roof, floors, and stairs are included.
- **Dimensions**: Heights and lengths of building components are marked clearly. For example:
  - Ground floor level at **+0.00**
  - Attic floor level at **+2.96**
  - Roof height reaching **+8.05** at the peak.
- **Materials**: The drawing outlines various materials used in the construction, represented through symbols.
- **Insulation and construction layers**: Specific layers for insulation and structural components such as floors, walls, and roofing are indicated.

### Construction Details:
- **Roofing**: Sloped roof with a peak height of **+8.05 m** and insulation materials.
- **Staircases**: Internal staircase connections between floors are shown, ensuring the functionality of the multi-level house.
- **Foundation**: The foundation depth is marked, indicating a depth of **-3.84 m** below ground level.

### Annotations:
- The drawing includes several notes:
  - All dimensions are in centimeters.
  - The thermal insulation factor (U) complies with applicable standards.
